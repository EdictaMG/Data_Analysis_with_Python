# Business Strategy on Discounts

This repository documents a project where I work with raw data, clean and validate it for quality, and perform analyses to provide a final recommendation for a fictitious company Board.

The main questions I aimed to answer were:

1. **Primary question:** Is it beneficial for the business strategy to discount products?
2. **Secondary question:** How can data collection processes be improved?

## Situation

Eniac is a Europe-based company that sells tech products and accessories. The company is currently debating whether offering discounts on products is beneficial to its overall business strategy.

On one side, the Marketing Team Lead believes that discounts are a valuable tool for long-term growth. They argue that discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention, all of which help drive the company's expansion.

On the other side, the Board is concerned about the potential downsides of aggressive discounting. While recent quarterly results show an increase in orders, there was a corresponding decrease in total revenue. The Board prefers the company to position itself in the higher-quality market segment, rather than competing on price alone.
