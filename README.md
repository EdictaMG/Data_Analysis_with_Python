# Business strategy on discounts
This repository documents a project working with raw data, cleaning and checking data for quality, and conducting analyses for a final recommendation to a fictive company Board.

I sought to answer the following two questions:
1. **Primary question:** Is it beneficial to the business' strategy to discount products?
2. **Secondary question:** How could data collection be improved?

## Situation
Eniac is an Europe-based company that sells tech products and accessories.  The company has an ongoing debate on whether or not it is beneficial to discount products.

On the one hand, the company's Marketing Team Lead believes discounts are beneficial in the long-run and that discounts improve customer acquisition, satisfaction and retention, and allow the company to grow.

On the other hand, the company's Board is worried about offering aggressive discounts.  The recent quarterly results showed an increase in orders placed, but a decrease in total revenue.  They prefer that the company positions itself in the quality segment rather than competing to offer the lowest prices in the market.
